<div class='name'>Oleksandr Gergardt, CTO</div>
<div class='profile'>I graduated from the best technician university of Ukraine. Summary, I have worked in IT more then 7 years. My last job was in large telecommunication company Ukrtelecom Joint Stock Company (www.ukrtelecom.ua) where I had worked for 4 years. At that time I was resolving interesting and often no easy tasks...  So, I&prime;ve got a great experience.
Then fate gave me a present: I won the Green Card and got the opportunity to live in beautiful Silicon Valley. Now I live in San Jose.
I have passion for programming, Unix-like operating systems, relational databases, JAVA-technologies, web services.</div>
